# Leaderboards

https://pkcody.github.io/Leaderboards/ (SPAM 'W')

Originally built as a timed collecting game that stores and retrieves and displays best scores via cloud-bases persistent leaderboard with implementation of server-side scripting to prevent client-side exploit.

I adjusted the theme to be a button presser game that slowly collects points the faster the player goes. The user can use 'W' or 'Up Arrow' with the leaderboard showing how many points players have after 10 seconds.
