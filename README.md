# Leaderboards

https://pkcody.github.io/Leaderboards/ (SPAM 'W')

Originally built a timed collecting game that stores and retrieves and displays best scores via cloud-bases persistent leaderboard. Implement server-side scripting to prevent client-side exploit.

I adjusted the theme to be a button presser game that slowly collects point the faster the player goes. The use can use 'W' or 'Up' with the leaderboard showing how many points players have after 10 second.
